Hello! My name is Tsickhanovich Yura.

I'm junior front-end developer.

For almost 14 years I have worked in the food trade. And then I realized that I do not like this work anymore).

I changed my direction of activity and became a professional web developer.

From 2015-2018, I worked part-time on freelance, as a site layout specialist. 

Then I began to study the react and redux, I really liked it, reviewed many 
videos and read the documentation.

I also completed a 6-month react study course. After the courses I got a job as a developer
in Moscow IT company 'MAP', I work the for 6 month. Then I canged my job and got a job as a devoleper
in Minsk IT company 'Abiatech'. I'm still working here.

In 2008 I graduated from the Brest Polytechnic University with a degree in Economics and Enterprise Management.
